# CRUD-MVC
BuildABoard is my week 7 project, which intended to reinforce the CRUD aspect of development.(Create, Read, Update, and Delete)

Technologies incorporated in this project include Java, Spring MVC, basic jsp, and html/css. 

BuildABoard simply allows you to choose a skate deck, wheels, bearings, and trucks to build a complete skateboard.
Following the CRUD aspect, the user is allowed to create(add) there own options not listed, delete aspects they don't want,
and edit any aspect.

My first stubbling block was not fully understanding how the mvc linked to the html and jsp files. After learing how to
manipulate them, the logic of the program was fairly easy. The second stumbling block was/is CSS. I am still figuring out
how to work with bootstrap and all advanced functionality of css. 

I will add additional css to this program to make it look more professional. I also intend to add navigation bars for more
efficient formatting. I am also going to add more to the program. I want to link the features to sites the user can purchase 
each item. I also want to add editorial features on the aspects of buying each segment of the board. And last, I am going 
to create a skateguide for colorado skateparks.
